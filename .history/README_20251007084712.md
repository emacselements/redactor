- **Highlighting:** Highlight areas with semi-transparent color
- **OCR (Optical Character Recognition):** Extract text from selected regions (requires Tesseract)
- **PDF support:** Redact, annotate, and sign PDFs directly, including encrypted PDFs (with password management)
- **Undo:** Step back through up to 10 previous actions
- **Zoom & pan:** Per-file zoom, fit-to-window, and panning controls
